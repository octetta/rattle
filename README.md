# rattle - a REPL and audio playground

Based on AMY https://github.com/bwhitman/amy with my miniaudio replacement of portaudio and my "amy-message" example I hacked for that project.

## Build

```
# this
git clone https://github.com/octetta/rattle.git --recursive
# or this
git clone https://github.com/octetta/rattle.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
# then
make
```

## Run

```
./bin/rattle
v0w0f440l1;+500v0l0
```
